      title: 'God\'s Promise of Forgiveness',
      content: 'The Bible gives a clear and beautiful promise to every sinner who confesses: if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. This promise is unconditional for those who truly repent. God does not merely overlook sin; He forgives it and cleanses us from its stain. His faithfulness means He will always keep this promise, and His justice is satisfied through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: '1 John 1:9', text: 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' },
        { ref: '1 John 1:7', text: 'But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.' },

      keyPoint: 'God promises to forgive and cleanse every person who honestly confesses their sins.',

      title: 'Confessing Directly to God',
      content: 'The Scriptures teach that confession is to be made directly to God. David confessed his sin to the Lord and did not hide his iniquity. He said, "I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD," and the Lord forgave the iniquity of his sin. There is no Biblical requirement to confess to a human priest or intermediary. The veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom at Christ\'s death, signifying that every believer now has direct access to God.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Psalm 32:5', text: 'I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.' },
        { ref: 'Psalm 51:1-2', text: 'Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'Confession is to be made directly to God, not through a human priest or intermediary.',

    {
      title: 'Christ Our Only Mediator',
      content: 'The apostle Paul declares plainly that there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. No human being, however holy or ordained, can serve as a mediator between a sinner and God. Jesus alone holds this office because He alone lived a sinless life, died for our sins, and rose again. He is our great High Priest who ever lives to make intercession for us. We can come boldly to the throne of grace through Him.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: '1 Timothy 2:5', text: 'For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;' },
        { ref: 'Hebrews 4:14-16', text: 'Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.' },

      keyPoint: 'Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and man, and through Him we can come boldly to God\'s throne of grace.',

      title: 'Forsaking Sin with Confession',
      content: 'True confession must be accompanied by a willingness to forsake sin. The Bible warns that whoever covers their sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy. Confession without repentance is empty words. God desires a broken and contrite heart that genuinely turns from wickedness. When we confess, we are not merely listing sins but expressing sorrow and a desire to walk in a new direction by God\'s power.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Proverbs 28:13', text: 'He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.' },
        { ref: 'Psalm 51:17', text: 'The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'True confession involves not only acknowledging sin but also forsaking it with a broken and contrite heart.',

    {
      title: 'The Joy and Freedom of Forgiveness',
      content: 'When God forgives, He forgives completely. He removes our transgressions from us as far as the east is from the west. He casts our sins into the depths of the sea and remembers them no more. David declared that the man whose transgression is forgiven and whose sin is covered is truly blessed. The burden of guilt is lifted, and joy and peace flood the soul. There is no sin too great for God\'s forgiveness when we come to Him in humble repentance through Jesus Christ.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Psalm 103:12', text: 'As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.' },
        { ref: 'Psalm 32:1-2', text: 'Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.' },
        { ref: 'Micah 7:19', text: 'He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'God removes our sins completely, bringing joy, freedom, and peace to the repentant heart.',
