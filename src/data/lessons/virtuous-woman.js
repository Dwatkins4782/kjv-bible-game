      title: 'Her Incomparable Worth',
      content: 'Proverbs 31 begins by asking who can find a virtuous woman, immediately declaring that her price is far above rubies. The word "virtuous" in Hebrew conveys strength, capability, and moral excellence. This is not a weak or passive woman but one of noble character and exceptional value. Her husband safely trusts in her, and she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. A strong marriage built on trust and faithfulness is at the foundation of her household.',

      title: 'Her Industry and Diligence',
      content: 'The Proverbs 31 woman is industrious and hardworking. She seeks out wool and flax and works willingly with her hands. She rises early to provide food for her household and is compared to the merchant ships that bring goods from afar. She evaluates a field, purchases it, and plants a vineyard with the fruit of her hands. Her candle does not go out by night, signifying her tireless dedication to her responsibilities. She is a model of diligence and resourcefulness.',

      title: 'Her Wisdom and Kindness',
      content: 'She opens her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindness. The virtuous woman is not only strong and hardworking but also wise and gentle in her speech. She does not gossip, complain, or speak harshly. Instead, her words build up, encourage, and instruct. She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. Her children and her husband both rise up to call her blessed and to praise her.',

      title: 'Her True Beauty: The Fear of the Lord',
      content: 'The passage concludes with the most important quality of all. Favour is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. The world chases after outward beauty and charm, but Scripture declares these are fleeting and deceptive. True, lasting beauty comes from a heart that reverences and obeys God. The hidden person of the heart, with a meek and quiet spirit, is what is precious in God\'s sight.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Proverbs 31:30-31', text: 'Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.' },
        { ref: '1 Peter 3:3-4', text: 'Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.' },
