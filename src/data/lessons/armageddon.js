      title: 'What Is Armageddon?',
      content:
        'The word "Armageddon" appears only once in the entire Bible -- in Revelation 16:16. It comes from the Hebrew "Har Megiddo," meaning "Mountain of Megiddo." Megiddo was an ancient city in Israel located at a strategic crossroads where many decisive battles were fought throughout Old Testament history. However, the battle of Armageddon is not merely a military conflict in the Middle East. In the context of Revelation, it is the final, climactic battle between the forces of good and evil -- between Christ and His people on one side, and Satan with the kings of the earth on the other. It is a spiritual war with global dimensions.',

      title: 'The Three Unclean Spirits',
      content:
        'Before Armageddon takes place, three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouths of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet. In Bible prophecy, the dragon represents Satan working through paganism and spiritualism, the beast represents the papal system, and the false prophet represents apostate Protestantism. These three unclean spirits represent the deceptive teachings and satanic miracles that unite the entire world against God\'s truth. Through miracles and deception, these three powers will forge an unholy alliance and gather the kings of the earth for the final battle against God\'s remnant people.',

      title: 'The Valley of Decision',
      content:
        'The prophet Joel describes this same final gathering in vivid language. The nations are brought into the "valley of Jehoshaphat" (meaning "the LORD judges") and the "valley of decision." Multitudes upon multitudes must decide whom they will serve. This is not a decision that God makes for them -- it is the final call for every soul to choose between obedience to God and obedience to the powers of this world. The harvest of the earth is ripe, meaning that the character of every person has been fully developed, either for good or for evil.',

      title: 'Christ Conquers at Armageddon',
      content:
        'The outcome of Armageddon is never in doubt. Revelation 17:14 declares plainly that the Lamb shall overcome, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings. In Revelation 19, John sees heaven opened and Christ riding forth on a white horse, called "Faithful and True," leading the armies of heaven. The beast, the false prophet, and the kings of the earth are gathered against Him, but they are utterly defeated. The beast and false prophet are cast alive into the lake of fire. Christ does not need human weapons -- the sword that proceeds from His mouth (the Word of God) is sufficient to conquer all His enemies.',

      title: 'How God\'s People Prepare',
      content:
        'In the middle of the description of Armageddon, Jesus inserts a personal appeal: "Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame." This is Christ\'s direct counsel for living in the time leading up to Armageddon. We must be spiritually awake, watching the signs of the times. We must keep our garments -- the robe of Christ\'s righteousness obtained by faith. Those who are with Christ at Armageddon are described as "called, and chosen, and faithful." Faithfulness to God\'s Word and commandments is the preparation that will see us through the final crisis.',
