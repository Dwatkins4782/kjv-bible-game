      title: 'Jesus\' Warning on the Mount of Olives',
      content:
        'When the disciples asked Jesus about the signs of His coming and the end of the world, He pointed them back to the prophet Daniel and spoke of the "abomination of desolation" standing in the holy place. This warning was so important that Jesus said "whoso readeth, let him understand." The abomination of desolation has both a near and far fulfillment -- it applied first to the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, and it applies again in the last days. Understanding this prophecy requires comparing the Gospel accounts with the book of Daniel.',

      title: 'The Abomination in Daniel\'s Prophecies',
      content:
        'The prophet Daniel mentions the abomination of desolation in three separate passages. In Daniel 9:27, it is connected with the destruction of Jerusalem after the Messiah is "cut off." In Daniel 11:31, a power arises that takes away the daily sacrifice and places the abomination that maketh desolate. In Daniel 12:11, a specific time period of 1,290 days is given from the time the daily is taken away and the abomination set up. These passages point to a desolating power that would displace the true worship of God and substitute a counterfeit system in its place.',

      title: 'The First Fulfillment: Destruction of Jerusalem',
      content:
        'Luke\'s Gospel provides the clearest interpretation of the first fulfillment. Where Matthew and Mark say "abomination of desolation standing in the holy place," Luke specifies "Jerusalem compassed with armies." In AD 66, when the Roman armies under Cestius first surrounded Jerusalem, the Christians remembered Jesus\' words and recognized the sign. When the Romans temporarily withdrew, every Christian fled the city. When Titus returned in AD 70, the city was utterly destroyed, the temple was burned, and over a million Jews perished. Not one Christian who heeded Christ\'s warning was lost.',

But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.',

      title: 'What Stands in the Holy Place',
      content:
        'The phrase "standing in the holy place" carries deep significance. The holy place belongs to God alone -- it is where His truth, His worship, and His authority reside. When any earthly power or system places itself in the position that belongs to God, claiming divine prerogatives, altering God\'s law, or substituting human authority for divine authority, this constitutes an abomination. The apostle Paul spoke of a "man of sin" who would sit "in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God." This aligns with Daniel\'s description of a power that would "think to change times and laws" (Daniel 7:25). The abomination is not merely a single event but a system that usurps Christ\'s authority.',

      title: 'The Final Application and Our Preparation',
      content:
        'Just as the early Christians watched for the sign Jesus gave and were saved from destruction, God\'s people in the last days must understand and watch for the final abomination of desolation. When human laws are enacted that compel worship contrary to God\'s commandments, when religious liberty is taken away and a false system of worship is enforced, then God\'s people must recognize the sign and take their stand with God rather than men. The counsel Jesus gave -- to flee, to pray, and not to turn back -- carries urgent spiritual meaning for the last generation. Our safety lies in knowing the Word of God and being rooted in Christ.',
