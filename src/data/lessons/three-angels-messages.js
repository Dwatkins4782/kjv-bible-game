      title: 'Fear God and Give Glory to Him',
      content: 'The first angel\'s message calls humanity to fear God and give Him glory, for the hour of His judgment is come. To fear God means to reverence Him and keep His commandments. To give Him glory means to honor Him in all that we do, including how we treat our bodies and how we live. The call to worship Him that made heaven and earth echoes the fourth commandment and the Sabbath, pointing people back to the Creator.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Revelation 14:7', text: 'Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.' },

      title: 'The Second Angel: Babylon Is Fallen',
      content: 'The second angel announces the fall of Babylon. In Bible prophecy, Babylon represents a system of false worship and confusion that has led the world astray from pure Biblical truth. She has made all nations drink of the wine of her fornication, meaning her false doctrines have spread throughout the earth. This message calls God\'s people to recognize the corruption and come out of the fallen system.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Revelation 14:8', text: 'And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.' },
        { ref: 'Revelation 18:4', text: 'And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'Babylon is fallen because of her false doctrines, and God calls His sincere people to come out of her.',

      title: 'The Third Angel: Warning Against the Mark of the Beast',
      content: 'The third angel delivers the most solemn warning found in all of Scripture. Those who receive the mark of the beast and worship his image will drink of the wine of the wrath of God poured out without mixture. This is unmixed wrath, with no mercy blended in. The mark of the beast is received in the forehead (by conviction) or in the hand (by practice), and it stands in direct opposition to the seal of God.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Revelation 14:9-10', text: 'And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:' },
        { ref: 'Revelation 13:16-17', text: 'And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'The third angel\'s message is the most solemn warning ever given, against receiving the mark of the beast.',
    },
    {
      title: 'The Patience of the Saints',
      content: 'After delivering these three messages, Scripture identifies a special group of people. They are described by three characteristics: they have the patience of the saints, they keep the commandments of God, and they have the faith of Jesus. This group stands in contrast to those who receive the mark. Their patience is endurance through trial. They keep all of God\'s commandments, including the Sabbath. And they possess the living, active faith of Jesus Himself.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Revelation 14:12', text: 'Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.' },
        { ref: 'Daniel 7:25', text: 'And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'God\'s end-time people are identified by patience, commandment-keeping, and the faith of Jesus.',
    },
    {
      title: 'The Urgency of the Messages',
      content: 'The three angels\' messages are God\'s final appeal to a dying world. A fourth angel joins with great power to lighten the whole earth with the glory of God\'s character. These messages are not merely theological concepts but present-truth calls to action. Every person on earth will ultimately decide whether to receive the seal of God or the mark of the beast. There is no neutral ground. The time to choose is now.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Revelation 18:1', text: 'And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.' },
        { ref: 'Revelation 14:11', text: 'And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'The three angels\' messages demand a decision from every person on earth, and a fourth angel empowers the final proclamation.',
