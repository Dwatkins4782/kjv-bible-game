      title: 'The Origin of Babylon',
      content:
        'The name "Babylon" originates from the ancient city of Babel, where humanity first attempted to defy God by building a tower to heaven. This act of rebellion and self-exaltation established the spiritual pattern that Babylon represents throughout Scripture: opposition to God through human pride, false worship, and confusion. Understanding the origin of literal Babylon helps us understand its prophetic meaning.',

      title: 'Babylon the Great in Prophecy',
      content:
        'In Revelation 17, the apostle John is shown a vision of a woman sitting upon a scarlet-coloured beast. In Bible prophecy, a woman represents a church (Jeremiah 6:2, 2 Corinthians 11:2), and this particular woman is depicted as corrupt and unfaithful. She is called "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT" and is the mother of harlots, meaning she has produced daughter churches that have followed her false teachings. She holds a golden cup full of abominations -- representing her corrupt doctrines that she has made the nations drink.',

      title: 'The Wine of Babylon',
      content:
        'The prophet Jeremiah described ancient Babylon as a golden cup in the Lord\'s hand that made all the earth drunk. This imagery carries forward into Revelation, where Babylon\'s wine represents her false teachings that have intoxicated the world. Just as a drunken person cannot think clearly or walk straight, those who drink Babylon\'s wine are confused about God\'s truth. Her doctrines include teachings that contradict the plain Word of God, substituting human traditions for divine commandments.',

Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD\'s hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.',

      title: 'The Fall of Babylon',
      content:
        'The declaration "Babylon is fallen, is fallen" echoes across both the Old and New Testaments. Isaiah prophesied the fall of ancient, literal Babylon, and Revelation applies this language to spiritual Babylon in the last days. A church "falls" when it rejects truth and clings to error, when it unites with the world rather than remaining faithful to God. The second angel of Revelation 14 announces this fall, warning that Babylon\'s rejection of God\'s truth has reached its fullness. This message began to be fulfilled when churches rejected the great truths of prophecy and continued to hold to traditions of men over the commandments of God.',

      title: 'The Call to Come Out',
      content:
        'God has sincere, faithful people in every denomination and religious body -- many of whom are in Babylon without realizing it. The message of Revelation 18:4 is a loving call from God to His people to separate themselves from Babylon\'s false teachings before her plagues come upon her. This is not a call of condemnation but of mercy. God wants His children to stand on the platform of truth, keeping His commandments and holding to the faith of Jesus. Those who hear His voice and respond will be gathered into the remnant who keep the commandments of God.',
