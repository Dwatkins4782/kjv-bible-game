      content: 'Before the final judgments of God fall upon the earth, four angels are seen holding back the winds of strife and destruction. These winds represent war, calamity, and the outpouring of God\'s wrath. They are held until a special work of sealing is completed among God\'s faithful people. This demonstrates God\'s mercy and His desire to protect His people before the end comes.',

And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.' },

The seal is placed in the forehead, representing a settled, unwavering commitment of the mind to God\'s truth. Just as Ezekiel saw a mark placed upon those who sighed and cried over the abominations in the land, so God marks those who grieve over sin and cling to His commandments.',

      title: 'The Special Resurrection',
      content: 'Daniel 12 reveals a special, or partial, resurrection that occurs before the general resurrection of the righteous at Christ\'s second coming. This special resurrection includes two groups: certain righteous individuals who died in the faith of the third angel\'s message, and those wicked ones who were responsible for Christ\'s crucifixion and the persecution of His people. Michael (Christ) stands up, signifying the close of probation, and a time of trouble follows such as never was. Then this special resurrection takes place.',

        { ref: 'Daniel 12:1', text: 'And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.' },

      content: 'The question is asked in Revelation 6:17, "Who shall be able to stand?" when the great day of God\'s wrath has come. The 144,000 are the answer to that question. They stand without an intercessor after probation closes, sustained by the grace of God. They bear His name and His seal, and they will see Jesus come in the clouds of glory without tasting death. Their experience demonstrates that, through the power of God, fallen human beings can live in perfect harmony with His law.',
