      title: 'How to Understand Prophetic Symbols',
      content:
        'Revelation is a book of symbols -- it was "signified" (sign-ified, communicated through signs) by the angel to John. Many people find Revelation confusing because they try to interpret these symbols literally. The key to understanding Revelation is to let the Bible interpret itself. In most cases, the Old Testament and the book of Daniel provide the definitions for Revelation\'s symbols. A beast represents a kingdom or political power (Daniel 7:17,23). Waters represent peoples and nations (Revelation 17:15). A woman represents a church (Jeremiah 6:2). Horns represent kings or powers (Daniel 7:24). Wind represents war and strife (Jeremiah 49:36). Once we understand these principles, the symbols of Revelation become a clear and powerful message.',

      title: 'The Beast from the Sea (Revelation 13:1-10)',
      content:
        'In Revelation 13, John sees a beast rising from the sea with seven heads, ten horns, and a blasphemous name. This beast is a composite of Daniel 7\'s four beasts -- it has the mouth of a lion, feet of a bear, and body of a leopard. It rises from the "sea" (populated areas), receives its power, seat, and great authority from the dragon (Satan working through pagan Rome). This beast speaks blasphemies, makes war with the saints for forty-two months (1,260 years), and receives a deadly wound that is later healed. All the world wonders after the beast when this wound is healed. The identifying marks match the same power as Daniel\'s little horn.',

      title: 'The Lamb-like Beast from the Earth (Revelation 13:11-18)',
      content:
        'After the first beast receives its deadly wound, John sees a second beast rising from the "earth" (a sparsely populated area, unlike the crowded "sea"). This beast has two horns like a lamb -- appearing gentle, Christian, and freedom-loving. But it speaks as a dragon, meaning that despite its lamb-like appearance, it eventually exercises the same persecuting power as the dragon. This beast causes the earth to worship the first beast whose wound was healed, performs great wonders including bringing fire from heaven, and enforces the mark of the beast. The two lamb-like horns represent the twin principles that originally characterized this power, but which are ultimately corrupted.',

      title: 'The Seven Seals',
      content:
        'In Revelation 5-8, a scroll sealed with seven seals is presented in heaven. Only the Lamb (Christ) is worthy to open it. Each seal reveals a phase of church history. The first seal shows a white horse -- the purity of the early church going forth conquering with the gospel. The second seal reveals a red horse -- the persecution era when blood was shed. The third seal shows a black horse -- spiritual darkness and famine for the Word of God during the Dark Ages. The fourth seal reveals a pale horse named Death -- the result of centuries of apostasy. The fifth seal shows the martyrs crying for justice. The sixth seal describes cosmic signs (the great earthquake, the darkening of the sun, the falling of the stars) that herald the approach of the end. The seventh seal introduces the seven trumpets.',

      content:
        'The seven trumpets of Revelation 8-11 reveal God\'s judgments on the Roman Empire and the persecuting powers. Trumpets in Scripture signify war, alarm, and judgment. The first four trumpets describe the fall of the Western Roman Empire through barbarian invasions: the Visigoths (hail and fire), the Vandals (a burning mountain cast into the sea), the Huns (a great star falling), and the Heruli/final collapse (the darkening of the sun, moon, and stars). The fifth trumpet (first woe) describes the rise of the Arabian/Islamic powers. The sixth trumpet (second woe) describes the Ottoman Turkish power. The seventh trumpet declares that "The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord" -- the final triumph of God\'s kingdom.',

        'The symbols of Revelation are not random or confusing -- they form a consistent, interlocking prophetic picture. The beasts, seals, trumpets, and other symbols all tell the same story from different angles: the great controversy between Christ and Satan, played out through the history of the church and the world. The sea beast, the earth beast, the dragon, and the image of the beast all work together in the final crisis. But the Lamb who was slain is the hero of Revelation. He opens the seals, He sounds the trumpets through His angels, and He ultimately triumphs over every beast, every horn, and every persecuting power. Those who follow the Lamb will stand victorious on the sea of glass.',
