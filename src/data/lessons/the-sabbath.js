      title: 'The Creation Sabbath',
      content: 'The Sabbath was instituted by God at the very beginning of earth\'s history, before sin entered the world. After six days of creation, God did three things on the seventh day: He rested, He blessed it, and He sanctified it. This was not because God was tired, but to set an example and establish a holy day for mankind.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Genesis 2:1-3', text: 'Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.' },

    {
      title: 'The Sabbath in the Ten Commandments',
      content: 'When God wrote the Ten Commandments with His own finger on tables of stone, He placed the Sabbath commandment in the very heart of the law. The fourth commandment begins with "Remember," indicating it was already known and needed to be preserved. God commanded His people to keep the seventh day holy and to rest from all labor.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Exodus 20:8-11', text: 'Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'God said "Remember" the Sabbath, pointing back to creation. It is the only commandment that begins with "Remember."',

    {
      title: 'The Sabbath as a Sign',
      content: 'God declared the Sabbath to be a sign between Him and His people. It is a sign of sanctification — that it is God who makes us holy. The Sabbath is also a sign of God\'s creative and redemptive power, reminding us each week that we belong to the Creator.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Ezekiel 20:12', text: 'Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.' },
        { ref: 'Ezekiel 20:20', text: 'And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.' },

      title: 'Jesus and the Sabbath',
      content: 'Jesus Christ, our example in all things, kept the Sabbath throughout His earthly ministry. It was His custom to go to the synagogue on the Sabbath day. He declared Himself Lord of the Sabbath, and taught that the Sabbath was made for the benefit of all mankind, not just the Jews.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Luke 4:16', text: 'And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.' },
        { ref: 'Mark 2:27-28', text: 'And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'Jesus kept the Sabbath as His custom, and declared it was made for all mankind.',
    },
    {
      title: 'The Sabbath After the Cross',
      content: 'Even after Christ\'s death on the cross, His followers continued to keep the Sabbath. The women who came to anoint His body rested on the Sabbath day "according to the commandment." The apostle Paul also worshipped on the Sabbath, and there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Luke 23:56', text: 'And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.' },
        { ref: 'Hebrews 4:9-10', text: 'There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'The Sabbath was kept by Christ\'s followers after the cross, and Hebrews confirms a Sabbath rest remains for God\'s people.',

    {
      title: 'How to Keep the Sabbath Holy',
      content: 'The Bible gives instruction on how to honor the Sabbath. It is to be a delight, not a burden. We are to turn away from our own pleasures and business on God\'s holy day, and honor Him. Jesus also taught that doing good on the Sabbath is lawful — acts of mercy and compassion are always appropriate.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Isaiah 58:13-14', text: 'If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'The Sabbath should be a delight — a day to honor God and delight in His presence.',
