      title: 'Nebuchadnezzar\'s Dream: The Great Image (Daniel 2)',
      content:
        'King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had a dream that troubled him greatly. God gave Daniel both the dream and its interpretation. The king saw a great image with a head of gold, chest and arms of silver, belly and thighs of brass, legs of iron, and feet of iron mixed with clay. Each metal represents a successive world empire: Babylon (gold), Medo-Persia (silver), Greece (brass), and Rome (iron). The feet of iron and clay represent the divided nations of Europe that arose after Rome fell -- nations that would never fully unite again. This prophecy has been perfectly fulfilled over more than 2,500 years of history, confirming the reliability of Bible prophecy.',

      title: 'The Stone Kingdom',
      content:
        'The most important part of Nebuchadnezzar\'s dream is its climax. A stone "cut out without hands" -- meaning not made by human effort -- strikes the image on its feet and destroys the entire statue. The stone then grows into a great mountain that fills the whole earth. Daniel explains that in the days of these divided kingdoms, the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed. This is the kingdom of Christ, established at His second coming. The stone does not gradually transform the image -- it shatters it completely. This means Christ\'s kingdom does not come through gradual human progress but through divine intervention.',

      title: 'The Four Beasts of Daniel 7',
      content:
        'Daniel 7 covers the same world empires as Daniel 2 but adds important new details. Instead of metals, the kingdoms are now represented by beasts: a lion with eagle\'s wings (Babylon), a bear raised on one side (Medo-Persia), a leopard with four wings and four heads (Greece and its four divisions), and a dreadful, terrible beast with iron teeth and ten horns (Rome and its divisions). The angel explains that these four beasts are four kingdoms. A "little horn" arises among the ten horns, which speaks great words against the Most High, persecutes God\'s people, and thinks to change God\'s times and laws. This little horn power was given dominion for "a time and times and the dividing of time" -- 1,260 prophetic years.',

      title: 'The Judgment Scene',
      content:
        'After describing the little horn\'s blasphemous work, Daniel is given a vision of the heavenly judgment. The "Ancient of days" (God the Father) takes His seat, the books are opened, and judgment is given in favor of the saints. The Son of man (Jesus Christ) comes before the Ancient of days and receives an everlasting dominion and kingdom. This judgment scene takes place in heaven before Christ returns to earth. It is the investigative judgment that determines who among the professed people of God are truly His, before He comes to gather them. The little horn\'s dominion is ultimately taken away and the kingdom is given to the saints of the Most High.',

      title: 'The Seventy Weeks Prophecy (Daniel 9:24-27)',
      content:
        'The prophecy of the seventy weeks is one of the most remarkable time prophecies in all of Scripture. God told Daniel that "seventy weeks" (490 prophetic days, or 490 literal years) are "determined" (cut off) for the Jewish people. The starting point is the decree to restore and build Jerusalem, which was given by Artaxerxes in 457 BC (Ezra 7). From that date, sixty-nine weeks (483 years) reach to "Messiah the Prince" -- bringing us precisely to AD 27, the year Jesus was baptized and began His public ministry. In the middle of the seventieth week, the Messiah would "cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease" -- fulfilled when Jesus was crucified in AD 31. The seventy weeks ended in AD 34 when the gospel went to the Gentiles. This prophecy proves with mathematical precision that Jesus is the Messiah.',

And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.',

      keyPoint:

        'Daniel\'s prophecies span over 2,500 years of history and have been fulfilled with stunning accuracy. Four world empires rose and fell exactly as predicted. The divided nations of Europe have never permanently reunited, just as the prophecy said iron and clay would not cleave together. The little horn power arose and did exactly what was foretold. The seventy weeks hit their marks to the very year. These fulfilled prophecies give us absolute confidence that the unfulfilled portions -- the stone kingdom, Christ\'s return, and the eternal kingdom given to the saints -- will be fulfilled just as certainly.
