      title: 'The Promise of His Return',
      content: 'When Jesus ascended to heaven from the Mount of Olives, two angels appeared to the watching disciples with a powerful promise: this same Jesus, who was taken up from them into heaven, would come back in like manner as they had seen Him go. This is not a figurative or spiritual coming but a literal, personal, visible return of the same Jesus who walked the shores of Galilee, healed the sick, and died on Calvary. His return is the blessed hope of every believer.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Acts 1:9-11', text: 'And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.' },

      title: 'Visible Like Lightning',
      content: 'Jesus Himself described the manner of His coming so that none would be deceived. His return will be as visible as lightning flashing from east to west, illuminating the entire sky. There will be no secret about it. Every eye shall see Him. He warned against false christs and false prophets who would claim He had come secretly in the desert or in a secret chamber. The second coming will be the most visible, unmistakable event in human history.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Matthew 24:27', text: 'For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.' },
        { ref: 'Revelation 1:7', text: 'Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'Christ\'s return will be visible to every person on earth, as unmistakable as lightning across the sky.',

    {
      title: 'Audible and Glorious',
      content: 'The second coming will not only be visible but powerfully audible. The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God. The dead in Christ shall rise first, and then the living believers will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. This is no silent or invisible event. The shout, the voice, and the trumpet make it the most dramatic and awe-inspiring moment in all of history.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: '1 Thessalonians 4:16-17', text: 'For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.' },
        { ref: 'Matthew 24:31', text: 'And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.' },

      title: 'Signs of His Coming',
      content: 'Jesus gave specific signs so His followers could discern the nearness of His return. There would be wars and rumors of wars, famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in diverse places. The sun would be darkened, the moon would not give her light, the stars would fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens would be shaken. These signs have been fulfilling throughout history and continue to intensify, indicating that His coming draws ever nearer.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Matthew 24:29-30', text: 'Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.' },
        { ref: 'Matthew 24:7-8', text: 'For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.' },
      ],

    {
      title: 'No One Knows the Day or Hour',
      content: 'While Jesus gave signs of the nearness of His coming, He explicitly stated that no one knows the exact day or hour of His return, not the angels of heaven, but only the Father. He compared His coming to the days of Noah, when people were eating, drinking, and carrying on with life as normal until the flood came and took them all away. The lesson is clear: we must always be ready, for the Son of man comes at an hour when we think not.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Matthew 24:36', text: 'But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.' },
        { ref: 'Matthew 24:42-44', text: 'Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'No one knows the day or hour of Christ\'s return, so we must always be watchful and ready.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Be Ready for His Appearing',
      content: 'The proper response to the truth of the second coming is readiness. Jesus told the parable of the ten virgins, five wise and five foolish, to teach that preparation cannot be borrowed or done at the last minute. We must have a personal relationship with Christ, be filled with the Holy Spirit, and be living in obedience to His Word every day. Those who love His appearing and live for His kingdom will welcome that day with joy, not with fear.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Matthew 25:13', text: 'Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.' },
        { ref: '2 Timothy 4:8', text: 'Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.' },
        { ref: '1 John 3:2-3', text: 'Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'Readiness for Christ\'s return requires a daily personal relationship with Him and living in obedience to His Word.',
