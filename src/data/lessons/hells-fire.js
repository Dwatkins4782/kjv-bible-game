      title: 'What Happens When You Die?',
      content: 'One of the most misunderstood topics in all of Scripture is what happens when a person dies. The Bible teaches plainly that the dead do not know anything. They are not in heaven or hell watching over us — they are asleep, awaiting the resurrection. Their thoughts have perished, their love and hatred have ceased, and they have no more portion in anything done under the sun.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Ecclesiastes 9:5-6', text: 'For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.' },
        { ref: 'Psalm 146:4', text: 'His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'The dead know nothing — their thoughts have perished and they have no awareness of anything happening on earth.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Death Is a Sleep',
      content: 'Throughout the Bible, death is compared to a sleep. Jesus Himself used this language when speaking of Lazarus. He said plainly, "Lazarus sleepeth," and then clarified, "Lazarus is dead." The dead are not conscious in some other realm — they are resting in the grave until the voice of Christ calls them forth at the resurrection. Even David, a man after God\'s own heart, is described as sleeping in death, not being in heaven.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'John 11:11-14', text: 'These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.' },
        { ref: 'Psalm 115:17', text: 'The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.' },
        { ref: 'Acts 2:29, 34', text: 'Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'The Bible calls death a "sleep" — the dead rest unconsciously in the grave until the resurrection.',

    {
      title: 'The Soul That Sinneth Shall Die',
      content: 'Many believe that the soul is immortal and can never die. But the Bible teaches the opposite. God plainly declared through the prophet Ezekiel that the soul that sins shall die. Only God has immortality, and He offers eternal life as a gift through Jesus Christ. If the soul were naturally immortal, there would be no need for God to give us eternal life as a gift.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Ezekiel 18:4', text: 'Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.' },
        { ref: '1 Timothy 6:15-16', text: 'Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.' },
        { ref: 'Romans 6:23', text: 'For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'The soul is not naturally immortal — the soul that sins shall die. Only God has immortality.',

    {
      title: 'Hell Fire Destroys Completely',
      content: 'The Bible does not teach that hell is a place of eternal, never-ending conscious torment. Rather, the fire of God completely destroys the wicked — they are burned up root and branch, reduced to ashes. The wicked shall perish, shall be consumed, shall be as though they had not been. God\'s fire accomplishes its purpose: total destruction of sin and sinners.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Malachi 4:1-3', text: 'For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.' },
        { ref: 'Psalm 37:20', text: 'But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.' },
        { ref: 'Matthew 10:28', text: 'And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'Hell fire completely destroys the wicked — they become ashes and are no more. God destroys both soul and body.',
    },
    {
      title: 'The Lake of Fire and the Second Death',
      content: 'The book of Revelation describes the final fate of the wicked. At the end of the millennium, fire comes down from God out of heaven and devours the wicked. This lake of fire is called the "second death." It is not an eternally burning torture chamber — it is final, permanent, irreversible death. Even death and hell (the grave) are cast into the lake of fire and destroyed.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Revelation 20:9', text: 'And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.' },
        { ref: 'Revelation 20:14-15', text: 'And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.' },
        { ref: 'Obadiah 1:16', text: 'For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'The lake of fire is the second death — total, final destruction, not eternal torment.',

    {
      title: 'God\'s Character Revealed in the Truth About Hell',
      content: 'Understanding the true nature of hell reveals the character of God. He is not a cruel tyrant who tortures His creatures for all eternity. The wages of sin is death, not eternal life in torment. God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked but desires that all would repent and live. The destruction of the wicked is God\'s "strange act" — something foreign to His loving nature, but necessary to finally and forever remove sin from the universe.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Ezekiel 33:11', text: 'Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?' },
        { ref: 'Isaiah 28:21', text: 'For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.' },
        { ref: '2 Peter 3:9', text: 'The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'God takes no pleasure in destroying the wicked — it is His "strange act." He desires all to repent and live.',
