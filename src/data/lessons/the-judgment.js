      title: 'God Will Judge Every Work',
      content: 'The Bible makes clear that every person will face the judgment of God. Nothing is hidden from Him — every secret thing, whether good or evil, will be brought into judgment. This is not a threat but a solemn reality that should move us to reverence and obedience. The whole duty of man is to fear God and keep His commandments, knowing that judgment is certain.',

He saw the Ancient of days take His seat upon the throne, with thousands upon thousands of angels ministering before Him. The judgment was set, and the books were opened.

        { ref: 'Daniel 7:9-10', text: 'I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.' },
        { ref: 'Revelation 20:12', text: 'And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.' },

      title: 'The Judgment Hour Message',
      content: 'In the book of Revelation, an angel is seen flying in the midst of heaven with a special message for the whole world: "Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come." This is the first angel\'s message, and it announces that God\'s judgment is not merely future — it has arrived. This message calls all people everywhere to worship the Creator while the judgment is in session.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Revelation 14:7', text: 'Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.' },

      title: 'Every Person Must Appear Before God',
      content: 'The Bible teaches that every individual — both the living and the dead — must stand before the judgment seat of Christ. No one is exempt. Each person will give an account of himself to God. This is an appointed time that God has already determined, and He will judge the world in righteousness by Jesus Christ.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: '2 Corinthians 5:10', text: 'For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.' },
        { ref: 'Romans 14:10-12', text: 'But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

        { ref: 'Acts 17:31', text: 'Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.' },

      title: 'After Death Comes the Judgment',
      content: 'The Bible establishes a clear order: death, and then judgment. There is no second chance after death, no purgatory, and no reincarnation. Once a person dies, their record is sealed and they await the judgment. This is why the Bible urges us to prepare now, while probation still lingers, because the day of our death is uncertain.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Hebrews 9:27', text: 'And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:' },
        { ref: 'Ecclesiastes 9:12', text: 'For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.' },

      title: 'How to Be Ready for the Judgment',
      content: 'Knowing that judgment is certain, how can we be ready? The Bible tells us that Jesus Christ is our advocate — our defense attorney — in the heavenly court. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us. Our only safety in the judgment is to have our sins covered by the blood of Jesus and our names written in the book of life.',
      scriptures: [
