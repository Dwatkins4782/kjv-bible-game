      title: 'The Body Is a Temple',
      content: 'The apostle Paul makes clear that the body of a believer is the temple of the Holy Ghost. God dwells within us through His Spirit, and therefore we have a sacred responsibility to care for our bodies. We are not our own; we have been bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ. Because of this, every choice we make regarding what we eat, drink, and put into our bodies is a spiritual matter.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: '1 Corinthians 6:19-20', text: 'What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God\'s.' },
        { ref: 'Romans 12:1', text: 'I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'Our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, and we are called to glorify God in how we care for them.',

      title: 'God\'s Original Diet',
      content: 'In the Garden of Eden, before sin entered the world, God gave humanity a perfect diet. The original diet consisted of fruits, grains, and nuts. After the fall, herbs (vegetables) were added. This plant-based diet was God\'s ideal for the human body and represents the highest standard of health. The longest-lived people in the Bible lived closest to this original diet.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Genesis 1:29', text: 'And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.' },
        { ref: 'Genesis 3:18', text: 'Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'God\'s original diet for humanity was plant-based, consisting of fruits, grains, nuts, and later vegetables.',

      title: 'Daniel\'s Health Test',
      content: 'When Daniel and his three friends were taken captive to Babylon, they purposed in their hearts not to defile themselves with the king\'s rich food and wine. They requested a simple diet of pulse (vegetables and grains) and water. After just ten days, they appeared healthier and better nourished than all the young men who ate the king\'s food. At the end of their training, God gave them wisdom and understanding ten times better than all the magicians in the realm.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Daniel 1:8', text: 'But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king\'s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.' },
        { ref: 'Daniel 1:15-16', text: 'And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king\'s meat. Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'Daniel\'s commitment to a simple, God-honoring diet resulted in superior health and wisdom.',

      title: 'The Warning Against Wine and Strong Drink',
      content: 'The Bible contains many warnings against the use of alcoholic beverages. Proverbs paints a vivid picture of the devastating effects of wine and strong drink: woe, sorrow, contentions, wounds without cause, and redness of eyes. Scripture warns us not to even look upon the wine when it is fermented, for in the end it bites like a serpent and stings like an adder. Alcohol destroys judgment, health, and the ability to discern right from wrong.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: 'Proverbs 23:29-30', text: 'Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.' },
        { ref: 'Proverbs 23:31-32', text: 'Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.' },
        { ref: 'Proverbs 20:1', text: 'Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'The Bible clearly warns against alcoholic wine and strong drink, which destroy health and judgment.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Doing All to the Glory of God',
      content: 'Paul gives a comprehensive principle that governs all our choices: whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we should do all to the glory of God. This principle extends beyond diet to every area of life, including rest, exercise, and the avoidance of all harmful substances such as tobacco, drugs, and anything that damages the temple of God. Health reform is not legalism; it is a loving response to a God who desires our wellbeing.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: '1 Corinthians 10:31', text: 'Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.' },
        { ref: '3 John 1:2', text: 'Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.' },

      keyPoint: 'Every choice regarding health is a spiritual decision to be made for the glory of God.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Clear Minds for the Last Days',
      content: 'In the last days, having a clear mind is essential for discerning truth from error. Substances that impair the mind, including alcohol, drugs, caffeine, and tobacco, hinder the Holy Spirit\'s ability to communicate with us. Jesus warned that the last days would be like the days of Noah, when people were eating and drinking without thought. Peter urges believers to be sober and vigilant, for our adversary the devil seeks to devour us.',
      scriptures: [
        { ref: '1 Peter 5:8', text: 'Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:' },
        { ref: 'Luke 21:34', text: 'And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.' },
      ],
      keyPoint: 'A clear, sober mind is essential in the last days to discern truth and resist the devil\'s deceptions.',
