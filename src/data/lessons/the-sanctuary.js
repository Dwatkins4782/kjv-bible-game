      title: 'God\'s Command to Build the Sanctuary',
      content:
        'After delivering Israel from Egypt, God commanded Moses to build a sanctuary so that He could dwell among His people. This was not a building of human design -- God gave Moses the exact pattern on the mount, down to every detail. The sanctuary was a visual teaching tool, a three-dimensional gospel lesson that revealed the entire plan of salvation. Every piece of furniture, every sacrifice, every priestly garment pointed to Jesus Christ and His work to save humanity. God said, "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them." The sanctuary reveals God\'s desire to be close to His people and His plan for removing the barrier of sin.',

      title: 'The Two Apartments',
      content:
        'The earthly sanctuary had two rooms: the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, separated by a veil. In the Holy Place stood three pieces of furniture: the table of shewbread (representing Jesus as the Bread of Life), the seven-branched candlestick (Jesus as the Light of the World), and the altar of incense (the prayers of the saints mingled with Christ\'s intercession). In the Most Holy Place was the Ark of the Covenant, containing the Ten Commandments -- God\'s holy law. On top of the Ark was the mercy seat, where God\'s visible glory (the Shekinah) dwelt between two golden cherubim. This arrangement teaches that God\'s mercy and His law are not in conflict -- mercy meets the sinner at the very place where the law condemns him.',

      title: 'The Daily Service: Christ Our Sacrifice and Priest',
      content:
        'Every day, the priests performed the "daily" ministry in the sanctuary. A repentant sinner would bring a spotless lamb, confess his sins over it, and slay it. The priest would then take the blood into the Holy Place and minister before the Lord. This daily service taught several vital truths: sin requires death (the wages of sin is death), an innocent substitute can die in the sinner\'s place, and a priest is needed to mediate between sinful man and a holy God. Every lamb pointed forward to Jesus, "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." When Jesus died on the cross, the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom, signifying that the earthly sacrificial system had met its fulfillment.',

After His resurrection and ascension, Jesus entered the heavenly sanctuary as our great High Priest.

The book of Hebrews emphasizes that we have a living High Priest who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses because He was tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin. We can therefore come boldly to the throne of grace to obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Christ\'s ministry in the heavenly sanctuary is ongoing and personal.',

      content:
        'Once a year, on the tenth day of the seventh month, the high priest performed a special service called the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). This was the most solemn day of the Israelite year. The high priest entered the Most Holy Place with blood to cleanse the sanctuary from all the sins that had been transferred into it throughout the year. Two goats were selected: one was the Lord\'s goat, which was slain as a sin offering, and the other was the scapegoat (Azazel), upon which the high priest confessed all the remaining sins before it was led into the wilderness. The Lord\'s goat represents Christ\'s atoning sacrifice; the scapegoat represents Satan, who ultimately bears responsibility for all the sin he has caused. The people were to "afflict their souls" (examine themselves) on this day, and anyone who did not was "cut off" from the people.',

        'Daniel 8:14 declares, "Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." Using the day-for-a-year principle, and starting from the same decree of 457 BC that begins the seventy weeks, the 2,300 days reach to 1844. At that time, Christ entered the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary to begin the antitypical Day of Atonement -- the investigative judgment. Just as the earthly high priest cleansed the sanctuary of the accumulated sins, Christ is now reviewing the records of all who have professed His name, applying the merits of His blood to those who have truly repented and maintained their faith. We are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement right now. It is a time to afflict our souls, examine our hearts, confess every sin, and ensure we are right with God through the blood of Jesus.',
